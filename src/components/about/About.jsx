          <h2>Bonjour tout le monde !</h2>
          <h3>I'm <span>Ã‰lise</span>, born and raised in Southern France, now living in <span>Barcelona</span>. <br/> I'm a <span>front-end web developer</span>, still junior, but always giving my best to do an amazing job. </h3>
          <p>I'm mostly <u>self taught</u>. I'm a bachelor in <u>web development</u> and <u>web design</u>. But technologies evolve fast, so I continue to <u>learn everyday</u>. Skills can always be learned. That's why I'm <u>not afraid</u> to begin projects with technologies I'm not used to. This is how I like to <u>improve my knowledge</u>.</p>
          <p>I'm mostly <u>coding</u>. I've worked as a web developer for 3 years now. My job consisted mainly on <u>creating features</u> and apply a <u>new graphic chart</u> to a SaaS application developed in AngularJs then migrated to Vue.JS. I also was in charge of <u>maintaining</u> both front-end and back-end feature of a commercial website developped in Laravel and AngularJS. But I also like to <u>create assets</u> with Photoshop and Illustrator, or <u>create designs</u> with Adobe Xd.</p>
          <p>When I'm not coding, I'm probably video games, reading (horror) thriller/sci-fi books, transform fabric with my 1960's sewing machine or even 3d printing stuff. (Still trying to convince myself I should exercise, though...)</p>
          <p><b>My dream job?</b> I'd love to become a web developer in a team that makes me grow and ake me improve everyday, as we always have something to learn. The best also would be to have the convenience to work from wherever I want so that I can go see my family more often. After my father passed away, I've realised how important family can be to help you feel good. <br /> And also with colleagues that love "bad" jokes (the daddy kind of jokes ðŸ¤ª). </p>
